# parallel-computing

This project entails implementing two dimensional convolutions on parallel computers using different parallelization techniques and models.
The objectives are to design and implement parallel programs using different models for parallelization and communication. 2-D convolution
can be implemented by first taking 2-D Fast Fourier Transform of each input image, then perform point-wise multiplication of the 
intermediate results from the 2D FFTs, followed by an inverse 2-D FFT.
